**Technologies used:**
**React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update the user interface in response to changing data.

**TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. TypeScript helps catch errors during development and provides better tooling support for code editors.

**CSS:** Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. In this project, the styling is done using CSS to create a visually appealing and responsive user interface.

**HTML:** Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for creating web pages. In this project, HTML is used to structure the content and define the elements of the AutoCompleteChips component.

**Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-designed utility classes. It allows for rapid development and easy customization of styles without the need to write custom CSS. Tailwind CSS is used for styling in this project.

The overall structure of the project involves creating a React component (AutoCompleteChips.tsx) that manages state, handles user interactions, and renders the UI. TypeScript is used to add static typing to the React component, providing better code reliability and tooling support. The styling is achieved using Tailwind CSS, which offers a convenient way to apply styles using utility classes.
